      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way:    
      <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA,</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT,</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences and NM,</li>
        <li>Why, AZ.</li>
      </ol>  
    </p>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars,<br>
      When you can't see,<br>
      May get you,<br>
      A glimpse,<br>
      Of eternity. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      <ul>
        <li>cellphone,</li>
        <li>iPod,</li>
        <li>digital camera,</li>
        <li>and a protein bar.</li>
        <li>Just the essentials.</li>
      </ul>
      As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
